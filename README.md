# Welcome to the Sea-freight Automation Framework (SAF) Wiki

This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the Sea-freight Automation Framework (SAF). SAF is an initiative to create an automation framework and shift from current human control to machine control operation. If adopted by industry it should drastically increase the level of automation and reduce IT cost.

## SAF Foundation
Project is being developed by the SAF Foundation, an Estonian non-profit, with contributions from across the globe. The SAF Foundation’s mission is to promote and support development of industry wide standard APIs and communication protocols as well as research in Artificial Intelligence. Foundation promotes migration from current paradigm of “human control supply chain processes and manual user tasks” to paradigm of “machine controlled supply chain with process flow automation spanning over all supply chain participants with less dependency on human availability and efficiency”.
